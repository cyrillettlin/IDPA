Description:
A simple loabalancer between two or several hosts. 

This Loadbalancer was part of our IDPA work.

Usage: 
The best way to use our loadbalancer is with the docker container. 

Docker command: 
docker push 20200608/220001:latest

Otherwise you can just clone our git project and run the server.js.
